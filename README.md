This repository has been created for QA BE automation engineering challenge by Wallbox.
Automation framework has been created using Cucumber(BDD), using Java as programming language and RestAssured for API testing.

Note: since the admin user has been deleted while creating Postman Collections, Test Step Definitions on automation framework have been created partially.
